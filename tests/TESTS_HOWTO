==== How to run tests
1) By issuing "make check". This command will execute all tests in the list.
Issue: parallel run ("make check -jN") fails in test engine internals.

2) By issuing "python tests/<test_name".

Example: python tests/ext_global_func.py


==== How to add a new test

All variable parts are indicated with "<>".
Vocabulary:
	<test_name> - an arbitrary name for new test.
	<TEST_TYPE> - must be equal to "test_name", but in upper case 
	<func_name> - some new function to patch.


== How to create a new test:

1) Select a test name.

Example: lib_global_func

2) Create a C-source file named <test_name>.c in "tests/" directory.

Example: tests/lib_global_func.c

3) Test source file has to include "test_types.h"

4) Function prototype has to be like the following:

	int <func_name>(int type)

5) Function has to exit normally with:

	return function_result(type);

6) Function can return TEST_FAILED is case some internal logic is broken. 



== How to link new test to test engine

1) New unique test type has to be defined in tests/test_types.h as part of
test_type_t enum in a form:

	TEST_TYPE_<TEST_TYPE>

2) Test file has to be included (!) to tests/library.c to be built as
part of the library to patch. The reason is to prevent convertion of static
functions into global on linking.

3) The following hunk has to be to tests/library.c:

struct test_info_s {
        test_actor_t    actor;
        bool            match;
} tst_info[TEST_TYPE_MAX] = {
	<....>
        [TEST_TYPE_<TEST_TYPE>] = {
                .actor = <func_name>,
                .match = <MATCH_FLAG>,
        },
	<....>
};

where <MATCH_FLAG> indicates, whether patched result has to be equal to
original result ("true") on not ("false").


== How to build new test

1) Add new patch target to tests/Makefile.am by following this pattern:

	patch_<test_name>.so$(EXEEXT): <test_name>.c

Example: patch_lib_global_func.so$(EXEEXT): lib_global_func.c

2) Add patch target to "check_PROGRAMS" goal in tests/Makefile.am

Example: check_PROGRAMS += patch_ext_global_func.so


== How to add new test to automake check engine

1) Add test file to Makefile.am TESTS goal by following this pattern:

	tests/<test_name>.py

Example: TESTS += tests/ext_global_func.py



== How to mark test as XFAIL:

1) Add test name to XFAIL_TESTS goal in Makefile.am

Example: XFAIL_TESTS += tests/ext_global_func.py

Notes:
1. test has to be a part of TESTS goal in Makefile.am.
2. test will be executed and marked as XPASS if succeded.
